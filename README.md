# Factory Pattern with TypeScript

This app demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern in TypeScript. Based on a given parameter, a shape factory decides whether to create a Circle, Rectangle, or Square object.

While building this app, I practiced:

- TypeScript interfaces

- Object-oriented principles like classes, abstract classes, and inheritance

- Clean and maintainable design patterns

- Error handling with try/catch and custom error messages

- Encapsulation using get/set methods

I developed this project during my TypeScript training based on an exercise from my trainer. It’s my own implementation focusing on clean code.
