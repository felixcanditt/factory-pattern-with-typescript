# Factory Pattern with TypeScript

This app demonstrates the Factory Method Design Pattern in TypeScript. Based on a given parameter, a shape factory decides whether to create a Circle, Rectangle, or Square object.

While building this app, I practiced:

- TypeScript interfaces

- Object-oriented principles like classes, abstract classes, and inheritance

- Clean and maintainable design patterns

This project was created as part of my TypeScript training and serves as an exercise in writing clear, extensible code.
